  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The Italic Iron Age is characterized by the presence
               of various ethnic groups partially examined from a genomic
               perspective. To explore the evolution of Iron Age Italic
               populations and the genetic impact of Romanization, we focus on
               the Picenes, one of the most fascinating pre-Roman civilizations,
               who flourished on the Middle Adriatic side of Central Italy
               between the 9th and the 3rd century BCE, until the Roman
               colonization. RESULTS: More than 50 samples are reported,
               spanning more than 1000 years of history from the Iron Age to
               Late Antiquity. Despite cultural diversity, our analysis reveals
               no major differences between the Picenes and other coeval
               populations, suggesting a shared genetic history of the Central
               Italian Iron Age ethnic groups. Nevertheless, a slight genetic
               differentiation between populations along the Adriatic and
               Tyrrhenian coasts can be observed, possibly due to different
               population dynamics in the two sides of Italy and/or genetic
               contacts across the Adriatic Sea. Additionally, we identify
               several individuals with ancestries deviating from their general
               population. Lastly, in our Late Antiquity site, we observe a
               drastic change in the genetic landscape of the Middle Adriatic
               region, indicating a relevant influx from the Near East, possibly
               as a consequence of Romanization. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings,
               consistently with archeological hypotheses, suggest genetic
               interactions across the Adriatic Sea during the Bronze/Iron Age
               and a high level of individual mobility typical of cosmopolitan
               societies. Finally, we highlight the role of the Roman Empire in
               shaping genetic and phenotypic changes that greatly impact the
               Italian peninsula.",
