This package contains data published in Amjadi et al., 2025 (Nature Scientific Reports).

The data was processed from BAM files available on the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under project accession PRJEB81975 (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB81975). The GRCh37.p13 reference genome was used to call pseudohaploid genomes. Resulting BAM files were converted to PLINK format using `adna_to_dataset, v0.8` (https://github.com/teepean/adna_to_dataset), specifically the bam_to_plink.sh script: `https://github.com/teepean/adna_to_dataset/blob/main/bam_to_plink.sh`.
