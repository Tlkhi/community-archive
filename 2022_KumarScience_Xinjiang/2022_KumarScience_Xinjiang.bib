  abstract  = "The Xinjiang region in northwest China is a historically
               important geographical passage between East and West Eurasia. By
               sequencing 201 ancient genomes from 39 archaeological sites, we
               clarify the complex demographic history of this region. Bronze
               Age Xinjiang populations are characterized by four major
               ancestries related to Early Bronze Age cultures from the central
               and eastern Steppe, Central Asian, and Tarim Basin regions.
               Admixtures between Middle and Late Bronze Age Steppe cultures
               continued during the Late Bronze and Iron Ages, along with an
               inflow of East and Central Asian ancestry. Historical era
               populations show similar admixed and diverse ancestries as those
               of present-day Xinjiang populations. These results document the
               influence that East and West Eurasian populations have had over
               time in the different regions of Xinjiang.",
